# Seedlet.md Typeface

A typeface made up of fonts designed to be used in Markdown authoring environments (e.g., app, web).

**Status: pre-alpha**

This project is at a very early stage with much to be done. The first, private/experimental implementation was created at the end of 2021 and little has been completed since. However, some colleagues have expressed interest in the idea, so... here we are.

## Usage

For now, here's a short example of using the typeface in the Figma app. So, definitely no JS/CSS -- this is not a Figma plugin, just a font selection.
